# Diabetes_Prediction
This is a diabetes prediction web application which can predict whether the person is having diabetes or not using predictive algorithm.

## To Build this Model following ML algirithms are considered :

1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN classifier 
3. Decision Tree Algorithm
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. AdaBoost Algorithm
6. Support Vector Machine

## Random Forest Classifier is a Best Algorithm As Per Evaluation Metrics such as 
1. Precision
2. Recall
3. f-1 score
4. Accuracy
5. Confusion Matrix
